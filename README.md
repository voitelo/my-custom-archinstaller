if you really want to use this script here are the commands to write in the arch iso live enviroument:

(be connected to internet and install the git package)

git clone https://github.com/voitelo/my-custom-archinstaller/

then

cd (then click tab and it should auto suggest that new git cloned directory, if not click tab a couple times, see the directory name, type it and cd into it)

then

sudo chmod +x archinstall.sh

then

./archinstall.sh
